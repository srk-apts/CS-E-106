## R Markdown

You can use LaTeX to type equations in RMarkdown. 

Basic modes are inline (so called `$latex`) and the equation model (`$$latex`)

### Inline mode

You can write inline what you want with (one) dollar signs like this $x_1 = x_2^2$.

(this is done by `$x_{1} = x_{2}^{2}$`, one dollar sign on sides)

### Equation model

When you want an equation on a separate line, you can do this (two dollar signs on sides):
$$x_{1} = x_{2}^{2}$$
(this is done by `$$x_{1} = x_{2}^{2}$$`, two dollar signs)

## Basics of LaTeX

1. Grouping is done by using curly brackets `{  }` ($\{ \cdot \}$)
2. Subscripts and superscripts are by underscore (_) and caret (^) $x_1$, $y^2$, $s_{12}$, $s_{12}^{34}$ (see grouping above, `$x_1$, $y^2$, $s_{12}$, $s_{12}^{34}$`)  
4. Greek letters are as you would expect $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\sigma^2$, $\varepsilon$,  `$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\sigma^2$, $\varepsilon$`
3. Fractions are done by `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`, i.e., $\frac{y^2}{x^2}$, `$\frac{y^2}{x^2}$`
4. Sum and integral, product, and E is `\sum`, `\int`,`\prod`, `E`, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x^2$, `$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x^2$` 
5. Infinity is `\infty` $\infty$, $-\infty$, `$\infty$, $-\infty$`
6. Brackets are either brackets or with `\left(` `\right)` (don't worry about this one)
6. You can combine it: 

$$\sum_{i=1}^{3} \left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x_i^2 \right) dx_i = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{x_i^2}{i}$$ 

```{r}
solution <- 10
```

The solution is `r solution`.
