**Solution 5:** 

**(A)**

*Given:*

```{r}
n = 45
F = 970
MSE = 80

```

$F = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$

```{r}
MSR = F*MSE
MSR
```

$MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-2}$

```{r}
SSE = MSE*(n-2)
SSE
```


```{r}
SSR = MSR/1
SSR
```


```{r}
df_R = n-2
df_E = 1

print(df_R)
print(df_E)
```

**(B)**

```{r}
R2 = 1 - SSE/(SSR+SSE)
R2
```

*Interpretation:* We get an R-squared value of 0.96 i.e. 95.7% of the variation in Y is explained by the independent variable X. Thus, the model is statistically significant based on $R^2$ value.
